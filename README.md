# Tandem Code Chellenge 2020

Quiz App utilizing REACT to play a round of trivia

App was created using Create React App and Tailwinds css.

# Goals

The app meets the following criteria:

• A user can view questions.

• Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time.

• Questions should not repeat in a round.

• A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.

• The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer

• A user can see the score they received at the end of the round

# How to Use

1. Load the codebase from github into the code editior of your choice.
2. In terminal window, run npm start to begin running the app (run npm install if missing needed dependencies)
3. Once the app has loaded, the first question will appear. Click on the answer that you think is correct.
4. After an answer is selected, you will be shown the correct answer. Click on the next question button to see the next question.
5. Once all questions have been answered, you will be shown the total score or the number or questions you got correct.
6. Refresh page to play another round of trivia.

# Future Development Goals

Some future goals for this app would be include a broader list of questions. Maybe using a trivia API that is availble to come up with the questions. Utilizing a database would then allow the user to be able to log in and keep track of their total score over many rounds of trivia. Implement a play again button would allow the user to play more than 1 round without having to reload the page to do so. The UI could also be refined to give a more streamlined appearance and less bootstrapy.
